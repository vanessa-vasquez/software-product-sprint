      <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
      <p>A little bit about me, I grew up in Sunset Park, Brooklyn which is basically a HUB for different hispanic cultures! If you ever head down, you should definitely visit! Currently, I go to Columbia University where I study Computer Science with a minor in French and Francophone Studies! </p>

      <h1> Current Hobbies </h1>
      <ul>
          <li>I've really been loving playing this game called Little Nightmares. It's super popular right now and the streams for it are always hilarious if you would rather enjoy watching it. As a horror fanatic, this game checks all the boxes!</li>
          <li>Binging Netflix (as one does)</li>
          <li>Learning French! </li>
          <li>Reading during my free time</li>
          <li>Listening to music - although, my music range is a mess. It's everything from pop punk to Aretha Franklin. Lol, I guess everything has its place. </li>
          <li>Being a bird mom to my green cheek conure Bailey</li>
